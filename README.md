This project aims to predict patients' length of stay in a hospital, helping healthcare facilities manage resources and operations more efficiently. The process involves importing, cleaning, and analyzing the training and test datasets, followed by feature engineering and building two predictive models: XGBoost and Naive Bayes. These models will be used to classify the length of stay, with their performances compared to identify the better predictor.

To run the project, load the datasets, clean them as demonstrated, perform feature engineering, and then train both models. You'll need Python libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, and Pandas. The final comparison of the models will help determine the most suitable approach for hospital resource optimization.
