The aim of this project was to accurately predict each patient's length of stay, enabling hospitals to optimize their functionality and resources. I first imported the training and test datasets, performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for both datasets, conducted feature engineering, and created both an XGBoost model and a Naive Bayes model to predict these stay lengths. I finally compared the accuracies of both models. I used the XGBoost model because it is a classification model that works well with a large number of data entries and a mixture of categorical and numerical variables in the dataset. Additionally, I utilized a Naive Bayes model because it is an effective classification model that is relatively fast to implement.
